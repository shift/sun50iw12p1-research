   - Recovery procedures for failed drivers

2. **Staged Hardware Deployment**
   - Critical drivers first (WiFi, display)
   - Non-critical drivers after basic functionality
   - Performance validation and optimization
   - User experience testing and refinement

## Risk Management and Safety

### Driver Integration Safety
