# HY300 Android Projector Linux Porting

## Project Goal
Port mainline Linux to the HY300 consumer projector, replacing the Android-based firmware with a custom Linux distribution optimized for projection hardware.

## Hardware Specifications

### Target Device: HY300 Projector
- **SoC:** Allwinner H713
- **CPU:** ARM64 Cortex-A53 quad-core
- **GPU:** Mali-Midgard (corrected from previous Mali-G31 misidentification) 
- **Architecture:** aarch64 (64-bit ARM)
- **Platform:** sun50i (Allwinner H-series)

### Key Components
- **Projection Engine:** Custom optics hardware
- **WiFi Module:** AW869A/AIC8800 (found in ROM analysis)
- **Storage:** eMMC flash storage
- **Connectivity:** USB, HDMI, WiFi

## Technical Approach

### Phase-Based Development
1. **Firmware Analysis** âœ… - Extract and analyze factory ROM
2. **U-Boot Porting** âœ… - Custom bootloader for H713
3. **Additional Firmware Analysis** âœ… - MIPS co-processor and complete component extraction
4. **Mainline Device Tree** âœ… - Complete device tree for mainline Linux
5. **Driver Integration** ðŸŽ¯ - Hardware-specific driver development and testing

### Development Strategy
- **Reverse Engineering:** Extract hardware configuration from factory ROM
- **Cross-Compilation:** aarch64 toolchain via Nix
- **Safe Testing:** FEL mode for recovery
- **Incremental Progress:** Boot stages before full system

## Technical Challenges

### Current Focus: Phase V Driver Integration
With all analysis and device tree creation complete, the current focus is driver integration and hardware testing:
- **Hardware Access Required:** Serial console and FEL mode access for testing
- **MIPS Co-processor Integration:** Custom driver needed for display.bin firmware loading
- **Mali-Midgard GPU Drivers:** Selection between Midgard and Panfrost compatibility
- **WiFi Driver Integration:** AIC8800 proprietary driver porting to mainline
- **Projector Hardware Testing:** Motor control, sensor validation, thermal management

### Hardware Dependencies
- **Serial Console Access:** Physical UART connection required (PH0/PH1 @ 115200)
- **FEL Mode Access:** USB recovery mode for safe testing (available via device USB port)
- **Complete Backup:** eMMC backup before modifications (established procedure)
- **Test Environment:** Controlled testing with recovery capability at each stage

## Development Environment

Uses Nix flakes for reproducible cross-compilation:

```bash
# Enter development shell
nix develop

# Or use direnv
direnv allow
```

### Toolchain Includes
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc
- sunxi-tools (FEL mode utilities)
- Device tree compiler
- Firmware analysis tools
- Serial console tools

## Risk Mitigation

### Safe Development Practices
- **FEL Mode Recovery:** Always test via USB recovery mode first
- **Complete Backups:** Full eMMC backup before any modifications
- **Incremental Testing:** Boot stages verified independently
- **Hardware Preservation:** No irreversible modifications

### Fallback Strategy
- Factory ROM backup for full restore
- FEL mode allows recovery without hardware tools
- Staged approach allows rollback at any phase

## Expected Outcomes

### Successful Port Delivers
- **Custom Linux Distribution:** Optimized for projection hardware
- **Open Source Drivers:** Community-maintainable codebase  
- **Enhanced Features:** Potential improvements over stock Android
- **Development Platform:** Foundation for further hardware projects

### Learning Outcomes
