- [x] Device tree compiles successfully (`sun50i-h713-hy300.dtb` - 12.9KB) 
- [x] Cross-compilation toolchain available in Nix environment
- [x] IR remote integration completed (Task 019)
- [ ] Analysis of current U-Boot configuration gaps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] USB support enabled in U-Boot (storage, keyboard, boot)
- [ ] HDMI display output enabled in U-Boot (early boot messages)
- [ ] Device tree IOMMU configuration completed
- [ ] Device tree power domain integration finalized
- [ ] All device tree TODO comments resolved
- [ ] U-Boot rebuilds successfully with new features
- [ ] Device tree recompiles to larger size with new features
- [ ] Configuration changes documented and validated
- [ ] Hardware deployment readiness verified

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Analyze Current U-Boot Configuration
- Review `configs/sun50i-h713-hy300_defconfig` for missing features
- Identify USB, video, and storage configuration gaps  
- Document current build size and feature set
- Research H713/H6 family U-Boot configuration requirements

### 2. Enable USB Support in U-Boot
- Add `CONFIG_USB=y` and `CONFIG_DM_USB=y` to defconfig
- Enable `CONFIG_USB_STORAGE=y` for USB boot support
- Add `CONFIG_USB_KEYBOARD=y` for USB input devices
- Configure USB host controller settings for H713
- Enable `CONFIG_CMD_USB=y` for USB commands

### 3. Enable HDMI Display Support in U-Boot
- Add `CONFIG_DM_VIDEO=y` for display framework
- Enable `CONFIG_DISPLAY=y` and `CONFIG_VIDEO_BRIDGE=y`
- Configure HDMI output timing and resolution settings
- Add early console output to HDMI display
- Test boot message visibility on HDMI output

### 4. Complete Device Tree Advanced Features  
- Implement IOMMU configuration for memory protection
- Add power domain integration for advanced power management
- Remove TODO comments from device tree source
- Verify all hardware components have proper bindings
- Add missing interrupt and clock configurations

### 5. Rebuild and Validate
- Rebuild U-Boot with updated configuration
- Recompile device tree with completed features
- Verify increased binary sizes reflect new functionality
- Test FEL mode loading of updated bootloader
- Validate device tree parsing in U-Boot

### 6. Integration Testing Preparation
- Update VM testing framework with new U-Boot/DT
- Prepare hardware testing procedures with enhanced bootloader
- Document new features and configuration changes
- Update deployment procedures and safety protocols

## Quality Validation

- [ ] U-Boot compiles without errors or warnings
- [ ] U-Boot binary size increase reflects new functionality (target: >800KB)
- [ ] Device tree compiles without errors (target: >13KB)
- [ ] All configuration options properly documented
- [ ] FEL mode testing validates new bootloader functionality
- [ ] USB device detection works in U-Boot console
- [ ] HDMI output shows U-Boot messages and console
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Next Task Dependencies

- **VM Testing Enhancement**: Updated bootloader for VM hardware simulation
- **Hardware Deployment**: Complete bootloader ready for real hardware testing
- **Service Integration**: Hardware-ready system for full service stack deployment

## Current Configuration Gaps Identified

### U-Boot Missing Features:
```bash
# Currently disabled in configs/sun50i-h713-hy300_defconfig:
# CONFIG_USB is not set
# CONFIG_DM_USB is not set  
# CONFIG_DM_VIDEO is not set
# CONFIG_USB_STORAGE is not set
# CONFIG_USB_KEYBOARD is not set
```

### Device Tree Incomplete Areas:
```c
// sun50i-h713-hy300.dts - TODO items remaining:
- IOMMU configuration (lines need addition)
- Power domain integration 
- Advanced interrupt routing
- Complete memory protection setup
```

### Expected Binary Size Changes:
- **U-Boot**: Current 749KB → Target ~850KB (USB + video drivers)
- **Device Tree**: Current 12.9KB → Target ~13.5KB (IOMMU + power domains)

## Architecture Integration

### U-Boot Boot Flow Enhancement:
```
ROM → U-Boot SPL → U-Boot → Device Tree → Kernel
  ↓       ↓         ↓         ↓          ↓
Power   Early     USB       Hardware   Full
Init    Init      Init      Config     System
```

### Hardware Support Matrix:
- **Storage**: eMMC + USB storage boot support
- **Display**: Serial console + HDMI output  
- **Input**: Serial + USB keyboard support
- **Network**: Ethernet (USB ethernet adapters)
- **Recovery**: FEL mode + USB DFU support

## Notes

**Critical Implementation Priority:**
1. **USB Support**: Essential for development and deployment flexibility
2. **HDMI Output**: Important for user experience and debugging
3. **Device Tree Completion**: Required for full hardware functionality
4. **Documentation**: Ensure all changes properly documented

**Hardware Safety:**
- Test all changes in FEL mode first
- Maintain serial console access for recovery
- Keep backup of working U-Boot configuration
- Document rollback procedures

**Integration Benefits:**
- **Complete Hardware Support**: No missing functionality for deployment
- **Enhanced User Experience**: HDMI boot messages and USB device support  
- **Development Efficiency**: Full hardware access during testing phases
- **Deployment Readiness**: Production-quality bootloader configuration
