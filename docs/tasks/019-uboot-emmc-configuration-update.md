# Task 019: U-Boot eMMC Configuration Update

**Status:** in_progress  
**Priority:** high  
**Phase:** VIII - Hardware Deployment Preparation  
**Assigned:** AI Agent  
**Created:** 2025-09-25  
**Context:** eMMC storage analysis completion, FEX files extraction

## Objective

Update U-Boot configuration to support HY300's 8GB eMMC storage with Android partition layout, enabling proper Linux boot from eMMC super partition while maintaining A/B recovery capability.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Task 003 completed - Basic U-Boot compilation for H713
- [x] eMMC storage analysis completed (docs/HY300_EMMC_STORAGE_ANALYSIS.md)
- [x] FEX files extracted with hardware specifications
- [x] Device tree created (sun50i-h713-hy300.dts)
- [ ] Cross-compilation environment verified

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] U-Boot defconfig updated for eMMC support
- [ ] eMMC controller (SDMMC2) properly configured
- [ ] GPT partition support enabled
- [ ] Boot environment configured for Linux kernel loading
- [ ] A/B partition awareness for recovery
- [ ] Environment storage configured in eMMC
- [ ] Successful compilation of updated U-Boot binary
- [ ] Configuration validates against FEX hardware specs

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Analyze Current U-Boot Configuration
- Review existing configs/sun50i-h713-hy300_defconfig
- Check current eMMC and partition support
- Identify gaps for 8GB eMMC with Android GPT layout

### 2. Update eMMC Controller Configuration
- Configure SUNXI_MMC for SDMMC2 (8-bit width)
- Enable HS400 support for eMMC 5.1+
- Set proper GPIO configuration for eMMC enable pins
- Validate against FEX file specifications

### 3. Enable GPT Partition Support  
- Add CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION=y for GPT support
- Configure partition detection and reading
- Set up support for large partitions (3GB super)
- Disable Android A/B in U-Boot (handle in bootloader logic)

### 4. Configure Boot Environment
- Set boot command to load from eMMC super partition (/dev/mmcblk2p9)
- Configure kernel command line for ext4 rootfs
- Set up proper memory reservations for MIPS firmware
- Configure boot timeout and recovery options

### 5. Update Environment Storage
- Configure CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_MMC=y
- Set environment partition (env_a at 0.25MB)
- Configure environment size and redundancy
- Test environment variable persistence

### 6. Cross-Reference with Device Tree
- Ensure eMMC controller settings match device tree
- Validate memory reservations align with U-Boot layout
- Check GPIO and clock configurations consistency
- Verify DRAM parameters compatibility

## Quality Validation

- [ ] Clean compilation without errors or warnings
- [ ] Binary size within bootloader partition limits (32MB)
- [ ] eMMC controller configuration matches FEX specifications
- [ ] GPT partition reading capability verified
- [ ] Boot environment properly configured for Linux
- [ ] Cross-reference with device tree shows no conflicts
- [ ] Memory layout accommodates MIPS firmware reservations

## Next Task Dependencies

- **Hardware Testing**: FEL mode deployment of updated U-Boot
- **Kernel Integration**: Linux kernel loading from eMMC
- **Rootfs Deployment**: Linux system installation to super partition
- **Recovery Testing**: A/B partition fallback verification

## Technical Background

### eMMC Configuration Requirements (from analysis)
```
eMMC Controller: Sunxi SDMMC2 (8-bit width, HS400)
Total Capacity: 8GB eMMC 5.1+
Partition Layout: Android A/B with GPT
Boot Partitions: boot0/boot1 (hardware) + bootloader_a/b (GPT)
Target Rootfs: Super partition (3GB at /dev/mmcblk2p9)
```

### Critical U-Boot Config Changes Needed
```
CONFIG_MMC_SUNXI=y                # eMMC controller support
CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION=y            # GPT partition support  
CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_MMC=y            # Environment in eMMC
CONFIG_ANDROID_AB=n               # Disable Android A/B in U-Boot
CONFIG_CMD_GPT=y                  # GPT manipulation commands
CONFIG_PARTITION_UUIDS=y          # UUID-based partition access
```

### Memory Layout Considerations
- U-Boot must fit in 32MB bootloader_a partition
- Environment stored in 256KB env_a partition  
- Kernel loaded to DRAM (avoid reserved regions)
- Device tree blob loaded before kernel execution

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **eMMC Timing Issues**: Improper clock/timing configuration could prevent boot
- **Partition Detection**: GPT parsing failures could block kernel loading
- **Memory Conflicts**: Overlapping regions could cause boot failures
- **Environment Corruption**: Bad eMMC environment config could brick device

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Conservative Configuration**: Start with standard eMMC settings
- **FEL Recovery Ready**: Always test via FEL mode first
- **Backup Strategy**: Preserve original bootloader_b partition
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each configuration change separately

## Notes

This task bridges our firmware analysis phase with hardware deployment readiness. The eMMC analysis reveals we need specific U-Boot configuration for the Android partition layout while maintaining Linux boot capability.

**Critical Path**: This is essential for hardware testing - without proper eMMC support, we cannot deploy or test the complete Linux system on actual HY300 hardware.

**Safety Priority**: All changes must be tested via FEL mode before eMMC deployment to prevent bricking the device.
