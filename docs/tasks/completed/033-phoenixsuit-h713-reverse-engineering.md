# Task 028: PhoenixSuit H713 Reverse Engineering

**Status:** completed  
**Priority:** high  
**Phase:** V - Driver Integration Research  
**Assigned:** AI Agent  
**Created:** 2025-10-11  
**Context:** PhoenixSuit is Allwinner's official Windows flashing tool with H713 support

## Objective

Download and reverse engineer Allwinner PhoenixSuit to extract H713-specific configurations, firmware formats, and flashing protocols that could inform our Linux porting effort.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Project Phase V active (Driver Integration Research)
- [ ] PhoenixSuit download location identified
- [ ] Reverse engineering tools available (binwalk, strings, IDA/Ghidra if needed)
- [ ] Windows VM or Wine environment for analysis (if needed)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PhoenixSuit downloaded and verified
- [ ] H713 configuration files extracted and documented
- [ ] Firmware image format reverse engineered
- [ ] Flashing protocol analyzed (comparison with FEL mode)
- [ ] Integration insights documented for Linux porting
- [ ] Findings cross-referenced with existing firmware analysis

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Locate and Download PhoenixSuit
- Search Allwinner official sources for latest PhoenixSuit version with H713 support
- Check linux-sunxi.org community resources
- Verify download integrity (checksums if available)
- Document version information

### 2. Extract and Analyze Tool Structure
- Use binwalk to analyze installer/archive structure
- Extract embedded configuration files
- Identify H713-specific files (*.fex, *.bin, config files)
- Document directory structure and file organization

### 3. Configuration File Analysis
- Extract sys_config.fex or equivalent for H713
- Compare with our extracted factory FEX files
- Identify DRAM parameters, boot settings, partition layouts
- Document any H713-specific quirks or parameters

### 4. Firmware Format Reverse Engineering
- Analyze image packing format (compare with Allwinner img format)
- Identify boot0, u-boot, kernel partition structures
- Document encryption/signing mechanisms (if any)
- Compare with our existing ROM analysis

### 5. Flashing Protocol Investigation
- Analyze USB communication protocols
- Compare with sunxi-tools FEL mode implementation
- Identify H713-specific commands or sequences
- Document differences from standard Allwinner protocol

### 6. Integration Analysis
- Identify insights applicable to our Linux porting
- Document driver loading sequences
- Extract hardware initialization patterns
- Create recommendations for testing phase

## Quality Validation

- [ ] All extracted files documented with purpose and structure
- [ ] Findings cross-referenced with existing firmware analysis docs
- [ ] Integration recommendations validated against current DTS
- [ ] Documentation updated in appropriate reference files
- [ ] No security-sensitive data committed to repository

## Next Task Dependencies

- Enhanced FEL mode testing with PhoenixSuit protocol insights
- Firmware loading system improvements based on format analysis
- Hardware initialization sequence refinements

## Notes

**Key Resources to Check:**
- Allwinner official developer portal
- linux-sunxi.org PhoenixSuit documentation
- GitHub repositories with PhoenixSuit tools
- Chinese developer forums (Allwinner community)

**Analysis Safety:**
- Run in isolated environment (VM recommended)
- Do not execute untrusted binaries on development machine
- Verify all downloads before analysis
- Document provenance of all extracted information

**Integration with Existing Work:**
- Cross-reference with `firmware/FIRMWARE_COMPONENTS_ANALYSIS.md`
- Update `docs/HY300_FEX_HARDWARE_ANALYSIS.md` with new findings
- Compare with FEL mode analysis in `docs/FEL_MODE_ANALYSIS.md`
- Add relevant findings to device tree documentation
