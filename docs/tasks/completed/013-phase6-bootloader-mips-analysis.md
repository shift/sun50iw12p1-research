# Task 013: Phase VI - Bootloader Integration and MIPS Firmware Reverse Engineering

## Task Overview
**Objective:** Begin Phase VI bootloader integration and conduct deep reverse engineering analysis of the MIPS co-processor firmware to understand kernel requirements and hardware integration.

**Status:** completed  
**Priority:** high  
**Phase:** VI (Bootloader Integration and Driver Testing)  
**Dependencies:** Phase V completion (Task 009-012)

## Background
We've discovered that the `firmware/mips_section.bin` contains a structured firmware database with device tree fragments, memory layout information, and MIPS co-processor metadata. This is critical for understanding how the Android kernel interfaces with the MIPS co-processor for display/projection functionality.
