# Task: Set up ROM firmware analysis workspace

**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** high
**Assigned:** AI Agent
**Created:** 2025-09-18
**Context:** ai/contexts/firmware-analysis.md, ai/contexts/hardware.md

## Description

Create a dedicated workspace and initial analysis structure for the HY300 ROM firmware image T08_user_public_en_chuangyihui_OTA_2024-04-19-2028.img once it's available.

## Prerequisites

- ROM image T08_user_public_en_chuangyihui_OTA_2024-04-19-2028.img downloaded
- Nix development environment activated
- binwalk and analysis tools available

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create firmware/ directory for ROM analysis
- [x] Extract ROM image structure with binwalk
- [x] Identify and isolate boot0.bin 
- [ ] Extract device tree blob from boot partition
- [ ] Document ROM structure in analysis report
- [ ] Commit analysis workspace (excluding ROM files)

## Notes

This is the first step in Phase I firmware analysis. The ROM contains critical DRAM parameters needed for U-Boot porting.

**Progress Update:**
- ROM analysis completed with binwalk - found 4 DTB files and GPT table
- Located 5 eGON.BT0 bootloaders at offsets: 136196, 168964, 612168, 843780, 1270600
- Extracted primary boot0.bin (32KB) from offset 136196
- DTB files extracted but need further analysis for hardware configuration
