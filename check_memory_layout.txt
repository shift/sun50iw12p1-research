H713 Memory Layout Check:

SPL Region:
  Start: 0x104000 (SPL load address)
  Size:  0xa000 (40KB from eGON header)
  End:   0x10e000

Scratch Region:
  Start: 0x121000
  Size:  0x1000 (4KB)
  End:   0x122000

Thunk Region:
  Start: 0x123a00
  Size:  0x200 (512 bytes)
  End:   0x123c00

Swap Buffer buf2:
  Address: 0x52a00  ‚Üê PROBLEM: This is in SRAM A1/C (0x20000-0x53fff)
  
ISSUE: buf2 at 0x52a00 conflicts with old H616 memory layout!
H713 needs buf2 in SRAM A2 range (0x100000-0x120000)

Proposed Fix:
  buf2 should be: 0x11e000 (safely below scratch at 0x121000)
