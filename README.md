## Current Status

**Phases I-V Complete:** All software analysis phases completed successfully - firmware analysis, U-Boot porting, additional firmware analysis, mainline device tree creation, and comprehensive driver integration research.

**Phase VI Ready:** Hardware testing and validation phase ready to begin, requiring serial console access and FEL mode testing capabilities.

**Key Achievements:** 
- Complete mainline Linux device tree (`sun50i-h713-hy300.dts`) with all hardware components
- U-Boot bootloader ready for testing (`u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin`)
- Comprehensive driver integration roadmap with multiple implementation options
- Complete firmware component analysis and driver patterns documented

**Next Priority:** Phase V driver integration requires hardware access for FEL mode testing, serial console access, and driver validation.

## Development Workflow

1. **Task Management:** Create numbered tasks in `docs/tasks/`, move to `completed/` when done
2. **Git Commits:** Reference task numbers, atomic commits with descriptive messages  
3. **Documentation:** Update analysis reports as discoveries are made
4. **Testing:** Use FEL mode for safe bootloader testing

## Hardware Access Requirements

- **Serial Console:** UART access via TX/RX/GND pads
- **FEL Mode:** USB recovery mode for bootloader testing
- **Complete Backup:** Full eMMC backup before modifications

- **MIPS Co-processor:** Custom driver integration needed for display.bin firmware loading
- **Proprietary Components:** WiFi (AIC8800) and some projection hardware may require reverse engineering
- **Mali-Midgard GPU:** Driver selection between Midgard and Panfrost compatibility

## Contributing

This is a hardware porting project. All development should happen through the Nix environment and follow the established task management system.
