# IRQ 110 Shared Interrupt Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhanced interrupt handling for IRQ 110 (shared interrupt) in the sunxi-tvcap.c driver, based on Task 022 analysis for shared interrupt with decoder subsystem.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Interrupt Statistics Tracking
Added `struct tvcap_irq_stats` to track:
- Total interrupts received
- Successfully handled interrupts
- Spurious interrupts (not for TV capture)
- Error interrupts
- Recovery attempts
- Last interrupt timestamp

### 2. Enhanced Shared Interrupt Source Detection
- Added `TVTOP_IRQ_SOURCE_DETECT_REG` (0x0044) register access
- Implemented proper interrupt source identification
- Added `TVTOP_IRQ_TVCAP_SOURCE`, `TVTOP_IRQ_DECODER_SOURCE`, `TVTOP_IRQ_DISPLAY_SOURCE` flags
- Enhanced `tvcap_irq_handler` to check interrupt source before processing

### 3. Interrupt Priority Handling
- Added priority control bits: `TVTOP_IRQ_PRIORITY_MASK` (0x0300)
- Implemented high priority setting: `TVTOP_IRQ_PRIORITY_HIGH` (0x0100)
- TV capture gets high priority on shared IRQ 110

### 4. Improved Interrupt Masking
- Enhanced interrupt masking for shared IRQ handling
- Proper mask preservation for other subsystems
- Temporary masking during error recovery

### 5. Error Recovery Mechanisms
- Automatic hardware reset for critical errors
- Interrupt statistics-based recovery tracking
- Subsystem re-initialization after recovery
- Error recovery logging and monitoring

### 6. Enhanced IRQ Request Configuration
Updated IRQ request flags to include:
```c
IRQF_SHARED | IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH
```

## Implementation Details

### Interrupt Handler Enhancements
The enhanced interrupt handler follows this priority order:
1. **Priority 1**: Error conditions (highest priority)
2. **Priority 2**: Frame completion (time-critical)
3. **Priority 3**: Input changes
4. **Priority 4**: Format changes

### Shared Interrupt Best Practices
- Check interrupt source before processing
- Return `IRQ_NONE` if not our interrupt
- Maintain statistics for debugging
- Implement proper error recovery
- Use hardware-specific priority settings

### Error Recovery Protocol
For critical errors (hardware, FIFO, timeout):
1. Mask all interrupts during recovery
2. Perform software reset
3. Re-enable subsystem
4. Restore interrupt configuration
5. Log recovery attempts and results

## Factory Firmware Pattern Compliance
Based on Task 022 analysis, the enhancements follow factory patterns:
- IRQ 110 shared with decoder subsystem
- TV capture interrupt sources: Frame done, input change, format change, errors
- Required flags: IRQF_SHARED for proper shared interrupt handling
- Priority handling: TV capture gets precedence over decoder
- Error conditions: Overflow, underflow, timeout, signal loss

## Testing Validation Required
- Compilation with cross-compilation toolchain
- Interrupt handling follows Linux kernel shared IRQ best practices
- Implementation matches factory firmware interrupt patterns
- Code follows Linux kernel coding standards

## Files Modified
- `drivers/media/platform/sunxi/sunxi-tvcap.c`: Enhanced interrupt handling
- Added interrupt statistics structure
- Enhanced probe function with IRQ priority setup
- Updated IRQ request with proper shared interrupt flags

## Integration Notes
The enhancements maintain backward compatibility while adding robust shared interrupt handling for the HY300 projector's IRQ 110 configuration. All changes follow Linux kernel best practices for shared interrupt management.
