	  Enable support for the Allwinner H713 SoC AV1 hardware decoder.
	  This driver provides V4L2 stateless decoder interface for AV1
	  video streams with hardware acceleration.

	  The H713 is the first Allwinner SoC with dedicated AV1 hardware
	  decoding capability, supporting 10-bit YUV420P AV1 streams up to
	  4K resolution with significant power efficiency improvements over
	  software decoding.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called sun50i-h713-av1.
