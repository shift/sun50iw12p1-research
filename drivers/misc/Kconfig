config SUNXI_MIPSLOADER
	tristate "Allwinner MIPS Co-processor Loader"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	help
	  Support for Allwinner MIPS co-processor loader driver
	  for H713 SoC. The MIPS co-processor handles display
	  engine control and projector-specific hardware management.

config SUNXI_NSI
	tristate "Allwinner Network Service Interface"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	select CRC32
	help
	  Support for Allwinner Network Service Interface (NSI) driver
	  for ARM-MIPS communication in H713 SoC. Provides shared memory
	  management and interrupt-driven command/response protocol.

config SUNXI_CPU_COMM
	tristate "Allwinner CPU Communication Interface"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI && SUNXI_NSI
	select CRC32
	help
	  Support for Allwinner CPU Communication Interface driver
	  for ARM-MIPS high-level communication in H713 SoC. Provides
	  HDMI input control, EDID reading, format negotiation, and
	  capture buffer management through MIPS co-processor.

config HY300_KEYSTONE_MOTOR
	tristate "HY300 Keystone Motor Control"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	help
	  Support for HY300 projector keystone motor control.
	  Provides hardware interface for projector lens adjustment
	  and automatic keystone correction.
